Hello! I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the University of Central Florida's Center for Research in Computer Vision ([CRCV](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/)).
My research advisor is [Dr. Mubarak Shah](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/person/mubarak-shah/)
I am currently working in continual/class-incremental learning, but I am also interested in cross-domain few-shot learning and explainable AI!
